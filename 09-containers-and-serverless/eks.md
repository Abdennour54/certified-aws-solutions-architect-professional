# EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service

## Kubernetes 101

- It is an open source container orchestration system
- We used to automate the deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications
- It is a cloud-agnostic product, can be used on-premises as well
- Cluster Structure:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is a HA cluster of compute resources organized to work as one unit
    - Cluster starts with the Cluster Control Plane: manages the cluster, scheduling, applications, scaling and deploying
    - Compute in Kubernetes is provided via Cluster Nodes: VM or physical servers which function as a worker in the cluster. These run the containerized applications
    - Software that will run on each node:
        - On each of the nodes runs a container runtime: `containerd` or other software used to handle container operations
        - `kubelet`: the agent which interacts with the control plane is. This uses the Kubernetes API to communicate with the control plane
- Cluster details:
    - Pods: 
        - The smallest units of computing in Kubernetes
        - Pods can have multiple containers and provide shared storage and networking for them
        - It is common to have one container per pod, although we can have multiple container in a pod
        - Pods are not permanent: they can be deleted when finished with a job, evicted because of lack of resources or when a node fails
    - Control plane runs the following software:
        - `kube-apiserver`: 
            - The front-end for the Kubernetes control 
            - It is what nodes and other cluster elements interact with
            - Can be horizontally scaled for HA and performance
        - `etcd`:
            - HA key/value store
            - Backing store for the cluster
        - `kube-scheduler`:
            - Identifies any pods within a cluster that does not have a node assigned
            - Assigned pods based on resources, deadlines, affinity, data locality and any other constraints
        - `cloud-controller-manager`:
            - Optional component
            - Provides cloud-specific control logic
            - It allows us to link Kubernetes with cloud providers APIs such as AWS
        - `kube-controller-manager`:
            - It is a collection of processes:
                - Node Controller: monitoring and responding to node outages
                - Job Controller: one-of tasks (jobs)
                - Endpoint Controller: populates endpoints 
                - Service Account and Token Controllers: accounts/API tokens
    - kube-proxy:
        - Every node runs it
        - It is a networking proxy
        - It coordinates networking with the control plane
        - It helps implement "services" and configures rules allowing communications with pods from inside or outside of the cluster
