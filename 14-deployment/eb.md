## EB Terminology

- **Elastic Beanstalk Application**: is a collection of things relating to an application - a container/folder
- **Application Version**: specific labeled version of deployable code for an application. The source bundle is stored in S3
- **Environments**: are containers of infrastructure and configuration for a specific version
- Each environment is either a **web server tier** or a **worker tier**. The web server tier is designed to communicate with the end-users. The worker tier is designed to process work from the web tiers. Web server tier and worker tier communicate using SQS queues
- Each environment is running a specific version at any given time
- Each environment has its own CNAME, a CNAME SWAP can be done to exchange to environment DNS
