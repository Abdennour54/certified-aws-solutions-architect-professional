# S3

## Storage Classes

- **S3 Standards (default)**:
    - The objects are stored in at least 3 AZs
    - Provides eleven nines of availability
    - The replication is using MD5 file checks together with CRCs to detect object issues
    - When objects are stored in S3 using the API, a HTTP 200 OK response is provided
    - Billing: 
        - GB/month of data stored in S3
        - A dollar for GB charge transfer out (in is free)
        - Price per 1000 requests
        - No specific retrieval fee, no minimum duration, no minimum size
    - S3 standard makes data accessible immediately, can be used for static website hosting
    - Should be used for data frequently accessed
- **S3 Standard-IA**:
    - Shares most of the characteristics of S3 standard: objects are replicated in 3 AZs, durability is the same, availability is the same, first byte latency is the same, objects can be made publicly available
    - Billing:
        - It is more cost effective for storing data
        - Data transfer fee is the same as S3 standard
        - Retrieval fee: for every GB of data there is a retrieval fee, overall cost may increase with frequent data access
        - Minimum duration charge: we will be billed for a minimum of 30 days, minimum capacity of the objects being 128KB (smaller objects will be billed as being 128 KB)
        - Should be used for long lived data where data access is infrequent
- **S3 One Zone-IA**:
    - Similar to S3 standard, but cheaper. Also cheaper that S3 standard IA
    - Data stored using this class is only stored in one region
    - Billing:
        - Similar to S3 standard IA: similar minimum duration fee of 30 days, similar billing for smaller objects and also similar retrieval fee per GB
        - Same level of durability (if the AZ does not fail)
        - Data is replicated inside one AZ
    - Since data is not replicated between AZs, this storage class is not HA. It should be used for non-critical data of for data that can be reproduced easily
- **S3 Glacier**:
    - Same data replication as S3 standard and S3 standard IA
    - Same durability characteristics
    - Storage cost is about 1/5 of S3 standard
    - S3 objects stored in Glacier should be considered cold objects (should not be accessed frequently)
    - Objects in Glacier class are just pointers to real objects and they can not be made public
    - In order to retrieve them, we have to perform a retrieval process:
        - A job that needs to be done to get access to objects
        - Retrievals processes are billed
        - When objects are retrieved for Glacier, they are temporarily stored in standard IA and they are removed after a while. We can retrieve them permanently as well
    - Retrieval process types:
        - **Expedited**: objects are retrieved in 1-5 minutes, retrieval process being the most expensive
        - **Standard**: data is accessible at 3-5 hours
        - **Bulk**: data is accessible at 5-12 hours at lower cost
    - Glacier has a 40KB minimum billable size and a 90 days minimum duration for storage
    - Glacier should be used for data archival, where data can be retrieved in minutes to hours
- **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**:
    - Approximately 1/4 of the price of the Glacier
    - Deep Archive represents data in a frozen state
    - Has a 40KB minimum billable data size and a 180 days minimum duration for data storage
    - Objects can not be made publicly available, data access is similar to standard Glacier class
    - Restore jobs are longer:
        - **Standard**: up to 12 hours
        - **Bulk**: up to 40 hours
    - Should be used for archival which is very rarely accessed
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**:
    - It is a storage class containing 4 different tiering a storage
    - Objects that are access frequently are stored in the Frequent Access tier, less frequently accessed objects are stored in the Infrequent Access tier. Objects accessed very infrequently will be stored in either Archive or Deep Archive tier
    -  We don't have to worry for moving objects over tier, this is done by the storage class automatically
    - Intelligent tier can be configured, archiving data is optional and can be enabled/disabled
    - There is no retrieval cost for moving data between frequent and infrequent tiers, we will be billed based on the automation cost per 1000 objects
    - S3 Intelligent-Tiering is recommended for unknown or uncertain data access usage

## S3 Lifecycle Configuration

- We can create lifecycle rules on S3 buckets which can move objects between tiers or expire objects automatically
- A lifecycle configuration is a set of rules applied to a bucket or a group of objects in a bucket
- Rules consist of actions:
    - Transition actions: move objects from one tier to another after a certain time
    - Expiration actions: delete objects or versions of objects
- Objects can not be moved based on how much they are accessed, this can be done by the intelligent tiering. We can move objects based on time passed
- By moving objects from one tier to another we can save costs, expiring objects also will help saving costs
- Transitions between tiers:

- Considerations:
    - Smaller objects cost more in Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, etc.
    - An objects needs to remain for at least 30 days in standard tier before being able to be moved to infrequent tiers (objects can be uploaded manually in infrequent tiers)
    - A single rule can not move objects instantly from standard IA to infrequent tiers and then to Glacier tiers. Objects have to stay for at least 30 days in infrequent tiers before being able to be moved by one rule only. In order ot overcome this, we can define 2 different rules
