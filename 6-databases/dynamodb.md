# DynamoDB

- NoSQL, wide column, DB-as-service product
- DynamoDB can handle key/value data or document data
- It requires no self-managed servers of infrastructure to be managed
- Supports a range of scaling options:
    - Manual/automatic provisioned performance IN/OUT
    - On-Demand mode
- DynamoDB is highly resilient across AZs and optionally globally
- DynamoDB is really fast, provides single-digit millisecond data retrieval
- Provides automatic backups, point-in-time recovery and encryption at rest
- Supports event-driven integration, provides actions when data is modified inside a table

## DynamoDB Tables

- A table in DynamoDB is a grouping of items with the same primary key
- Primary key can be a simple primary key (Partition Key - PK) or composite primary key (Partition Key + Sort Key - SK)
- In a table there are no limits to the number of items
- In case of composite keys, the combination of PK and SK should be unique
- Items can have, besides primary key, other data named attributes
- Every item can be different as long as it has the same primary key
- An item can be at max 400 KB
- DynamoDB can be configured with provisioned and on-demand capacity (capacity = speed)
- For on-demand capacity, we have to set:
    - Wite-Capacity Units (WCU): 1 WCU = 1KB per second
    - Read-Capacity Units (RCU): 1 RCU = 4KB per second

## DynamoDB Backups

- On-demand backups:
    - Full copy of the table is retained until the backup is removed
    - On-demand backups can be used restore data and config to same region or cross-region
    - We can retain or remove indexes
    - We can adjust encryption settings
- Point-in-time Recovery:
    - Not enabled by default, has to be enabled
    - It is a continuous record of changes
    - Allows replay to any point in the window (35 days recovery window)
    - From this 35 day window we can restore to another table with a 1 second granularity

## DynamoDB Operation, Consistency and Performance

- We can chose between to different capacity mode at table creation: on-demand and provisioned
- We may be able to switch between this capacity mode afterwards
- On-demand capacity mode: 
    - Designed for unknown, unpredictable load
    - Requires low administration
    - We don't have to explicitly set capacity settings, all handled by DynamoDB
    - We pay a price per million R or W unit
- Provisioned capacity mode:
    - We set the RCU/WCU per table
- Every operation consumes at least 1RCU/WCU
- 1 RCU is `1 * 4KB` read operation per second for strongly consistent reads, `2 * 4KB` read operations per second for eventual consistent reads
- 1 WCU is `1 * 1KB` write operation per second
- Every table has a RCU and WCU bust pool (300 seconds)
- DynamoDB operations:
    - **Query**:
        - When a query is performed we need to take a partition key
        - Query item can return 0 or more items, but we have to specify the partition key every time
        - We can specify specific attribute we would want to be returned, we will be charged for querying the whole item anyway
    - **Scan**:
        - Least efficient operation, but the most flexible
        - Scan moves through a table consuming the capacity of every item
        - Any attribute can be used and any filters can be applied, but scan will consume the capacity for every item scanned through
- DynamoDB can operate using two different consistency modes:
    - Eventually consistent
    - Strongly consistent
- DynamoDB replicates data cross AZs using storage nodes. Storage nodes have a leader node, which is elected from the existing nodes
- Writes are directed to leader node
- The leader nodes replicates data to other nodes, typically finishing within a few milliseconds

## WCU/RCU Calculation

- Example: we need to store 10 items per second, 2.5K average size per item
    - WCU required: 
        ```
        ROUND UP(ITEM SIZE / 1 KB) => 3
        MULT by average (30) => WCU required = 30
        ```
- Example: we need to retrieve 10 items per second, 2.5K average size per item
    - RCU required:
        ```
        ROUND UP (ITEM SIZE / 4 KB) => 1
        MULT by average read ops per second (10) => Strongly consistent reads = 10, Eventually consistent reads => 5
        ```
